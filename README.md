# My todolist-frontend

## Description
A very small Todolist project, which only has some simple pages and functions. Both the front-end and back-end are in my Github. In the future, I will add new things little by little in my free time to build a really useful program.

## Getting Started
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
